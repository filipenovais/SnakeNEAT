# SnakeNEAT

## Personal Project

### Year
2022

### Overview
This project applies the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm to develop an AI that can proficiently play the classic Snake game. Utilizing the Python library `pygame` for game development, this initiative showcases how evolutionary algorithms can be used to solve complex problems and enhance artificial intelligence through the evolution of neural networks.

### Features
- **NEAT Algorithm Implementation**: Employs the NEAT algorithm to evolve neural networks that control the Snake game, optimizing for survival and growth.
- **Game Development with Pygame**: The project leverages `pygame`, a popular library for writing video games in Python, to create a responsive and engaging Snake game environment.

### Functionality
The project's core functionality revolves around using the NEAT algorithm to continuously improve the AI's game-playing capabilities. By simulating generations of snakes, each controlled by a neural network, the system iteratively selects, breeds, and mutates the most successful candidates to produce increasingly proficient players.

### How It Works
The NEAT algorithm dynamically adjusts both the structure and weights of the neural networks based on the performance of each snake in the game. This approach allows the AI to learn from its environment and make increasingly effective decisions over time, without requiring a predefined network structure. The use of `pygame` ensures a smooth and interactive gaming experience, allowing for real-time observation of the AI's progression and strategies.
